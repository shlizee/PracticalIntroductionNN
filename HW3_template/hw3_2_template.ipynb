In an attempt to understand the types of features that convolutional networks learn to recognize, a recent paper [1] attempts to reconstruct an image from its feature representation. We can easily implement this idea using image gradients from the pretrained network, which is exactly what we did above (but with two different feature representations).\n",

    "Now, if you set the style weights to all be 0 and initialize the starting image to random noise instead of the content source image, you'll reconstruct an image from the feature representation of the content source image. You're starting with total noise, but you should end up with something that looks quite a bit like your original image.\n",
